## ğŸ“‹Description

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) is a cross-platform mobile application development framework that uses JavaScript and TypeScript. It allows developers to reuse code between different platforms, reducing development time and cost. React Native provides reusable UI components, access to device features through APIs, and allows interaction with web APIs. It is maintained by Facebook and widely used in mobile applications by many large companies around the world.

## ğŸ“‹ Requirements
React Native apps may target iOS 12.4 and Android 5.0 (API 21) or newer. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS. Tools like [Expo](https://expo.dev) can be used to work around this.
